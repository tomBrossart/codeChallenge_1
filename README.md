# codeChallenge_1

Follow the steps below to complete the code challenge:

## Tasks
  [X] set up index.html, client.js, javscript.js, and stylesheet.css
  [X] Create a <button> element on the DOM, you may do this in jQuery, or write it directly in the HTML code. Have the button text read "Generate".
  [X] Using jQuery, append a <div> element when you click the button.
  [X] Inside the <div> element you created in the previous step, create a <p> element
        ** ok so this p element will need to select the first created child and the
        challenge here seems to be how to add the p element to a div that is not created on page load
  [X] that shows how many times you have clicked the button from the first step.
  [X] Inside the <div> element you created in step two, append two <button> elements. The text of the two buttons should read "Swap" and "Delete".
  [X] In a CSS file, any <div> created using the "Generate" button should have a Red background-color.
  [ ] Swap button should should change its parent background-color from Red to Yellow.
  [ ] Clicking a "Delete" <button> should remove its parent <div> container (and all of its contents).




No need to do anything beyond the challenge described above. Once you are complete, check your code into a GitHub repo and submit via this application. Then quietly leave the room until the challenge is over.
